0. DOM -> CSSOM -> Render Tree
1. Style calculation - apply selectors to html elements.
2. Layout - based on info from "Style Calculation", sizes and positions of elements are set by browser. Result is a "Layout tree" which contains info where each element is position, visible it or not, etc.
3. Paint - paint pixels based on Layout.
4. Compositing - work with layers, z-index, gpu, etc.

Clicking on button to open modal for example would rerun the whole process from step 0. Render is costly operation.

1. window resize
2. font change
3. content change
4. add/delete classes, styles
5. DOM manipulation
6. change of orientation, vertical/horizontal
7. change of sizes/positions
