Direct manipulation will not be a tool that you reach for frequently. 
You will typically only be using it for creating continuous animations to avoid the overhead of rendering the component hierarchy and reconciling many views. 
setNativeProps is imperative and stores state in the native layer (DOM, UIView, etc.) and not within your React components, which makes your code more difficult to reason about.
