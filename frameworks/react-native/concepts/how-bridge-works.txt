There's two pieces of code: Native code, JS code.
To communicate there're using RN bridge
When user opens an app this is happening:
1. OS creates Main Thread (UI Thread) and assigns it to the app
2. Main Thread creates Shadow Thread (Tree) and JS Thread.
3. Shadow Thread job is to calculate layouts defined in JS Thread and send this info further to Main Thread

New RN Architecture:
JSI removes the need for a bridge between Native(Java/ObjC) and Javascript code. 
It also removes the requirement to serialize/deserialize all the information as JSON for communication between the two worlds. 
JSI is opening doors to new possibilities by bringing closes the javascript and the native worlds.
JS side and Native side can finally talk to each other!

Shadow Tree is written in C++, it'll provide the ability to write synchronous code

Scheme:
JS <-> JSI <-> JS Engine (JSCore, Hermes, Chrome(v8) for debugging)
