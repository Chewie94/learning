//REMINDERS:
    // 1. Use Effects only for code that should run because the component was displayed to the user
    // 2. An Effect describes how to synchronize an external system to the current props and state
    // 3. Each Effect in your code should represent a separate and independent synchronization process.
    // 4. Runs after DOM paint!
