Two core elements:
1. JS Engine - V8 (C++), made by Google, single threaded
2. Libuv (C) - 4 threads, responsible for:
    1. Crossplatform IO - work with netfork, filesystem.
    2. Event Loop

Node js libraries could be multithreaded due to Libuv!
From node.js v11.7.0 ability to control threads was added via module worker_threads
