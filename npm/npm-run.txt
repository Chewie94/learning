- What Happened to “npm run xxx”?

First, we install project dependencies through npm i xxx, such as npm i @vue/cli-service. 
When npm installs this dependency, it will create vue-cli-service in the node_modules/.bin/ directory as the name of several executable files.
The .bin directory is not the place to store the npm package. The files in this directory represent soft links.
Therefore, when using npm run serve to execute vue-cli-service serve, although the vue-cli-service global command is not installed, the 'npm' will find the 'vue-cli-service' executable file in the ./node_modules/.bin file directory 
and execute it as a script (equivalent to executing ./node_modules/.bin/vue-cli-service serve')

- Where is this soft connection executed?

When we use npm i to install dependencies, npm declares bin/vue-cli-service.js as bin.
vue-cli-service exists in package-lock.json file
After reading the configuration, npm will soft link it to the ./node_modules/.bin directory, and npm will automatically add node_modules/.bin to $PATH, 
so that you can directly run dependent programs as a command, with no need to install it globally.
